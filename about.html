            On my free time I like to do a lot of things. Somethings I do consist of watching my baby brother for my mom, watching Netflx, watching YouTube, going on Instagram, going on Snapchat, playing video games, making art on photohop, or playing guitar. I have been playing video games all of my life and I love it so much. Over the years I get better and better at FPS games. The first game I have ever played on Xbox was Halo 2 on the original Xbox. After that is was Gears of War, Grand Theft Auto 4, and Call of Duty: World At War.
